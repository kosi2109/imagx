## Key Features of Imagx - Cinema Booking App
- User Registration and Authentication: Imagx allows users to create an account, log in securely, and manage their profile information. User authentication ensures secure access to the booking system and protects user data.

- Movie Selection and Booking: Users can browse through a list of available movies, view showtimes, and select their preferred movie for booking. The application provides an intuitive interface to choose the desired date, time, and cinema location for the movie.

- Seat Selection and Price Calculation: The app enables users to select their seats from an interactive seating chart. As seats are selected, the application dynamically calculates the total price based on the seat prices set by the cinema. This feature allows users to easily determine the cost of their booking.

- Viewing Sold Seats: Imagx provides the ability to view sold seats within the seating chart. This feature allows users to see which seats are already booked by other customers, helping them make informed decisions when selecting their seats.

- User-Friendly Interface: The frontend of the application will be developed using JavaScript to create a responsive and intuitive user interface. The interface will provide a seamless booking experience, ensuring ease of navigation and selection for users.
